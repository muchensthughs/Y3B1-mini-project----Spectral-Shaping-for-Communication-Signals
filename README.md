# Y3B1miniProject-Spectral-Shaping-for-Communication-Signals
With the increasing popularity of ultra-wideband(UWB) communication, the interference between UWB and other narrowband transmissions has to be avoided. This project aims to modify a randomly generated signal sequence to achieve appropriate interference avoidance. The signal can be in the form of QPSK or 16-QAM.
